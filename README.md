# Hangman Game  
[Watch the demo](https://github.com/cris-mbici/hangman.py/blob/main/hangman.mp4)
. This is a simple hangman game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected word from a predefined word list. The game begins by asking for the player's name, ensuring the input is not empty. Once the player enters their name, they are welcomed to the game.  

A word is then selected at random from a file, and the player is given a limited number of tries to guess it. The word is initially displayed as underscores, representing the number of letters. The player guesses one letter at a time, and correct guesses reveal the corresponding letters in the word, while incorrect guesses reduce the number of tries remaining.  

The game continues until the player either guesses the entire word correctly or runs out of attempts. At the end of each round, the game informs the player whether they won or lost and reveals the word if they failed to guess it. The player is then given the option to play again or exit the game.
